# PyOpenSource

PyOpenSource is an organization committed to assisting people begin
contributing to open source programming projects. Currently the organization
can provide greatest assistance to contributing to projects written in Python
but if you need help navigating Github we can provide assistance for that too.

The two main sources of assistance offered by the organization are:

1. helping people learn the process of contributing to projects on Github and
   finding a project that interests them
2. providing a consistent meeting time to help people stay motivated and
   committed.

# Weekly Meeting Times

Sun, Mon, Thur 6-7:30PM (MST).

We meet on Google hangouts when needing to assist people beginning contributing
because we can make use of the screen share feature. Otherwise we will meet on
[discord](https://discord.gg/5eY6Y8u). Discord offers a text stream and ,when
necessary, voice chat rooms.
